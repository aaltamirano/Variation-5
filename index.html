			<br> From childhood's hour I have not been
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> As others were -- I have not seen
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> As others saw -- I could not bring
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> My passions from a common spring --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From the same source I have not taken
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> My sorrow -- I could not awaken
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> My heart to joy at the same tone --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> Of a most stormy life -- was drawn
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From ev'ry depth of good and ill
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> The mystery which binds me still --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From the torrent, or the fountain --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From the red cliff of the mountain --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From the sun that 'round me roll'd
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> In its autumn tint of gold --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From the lightning in the sky
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> As it pass'd me flying by --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From the thunder, and the storm --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> And the cloud that took the form
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> Of a demon in my view --
